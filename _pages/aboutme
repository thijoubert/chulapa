Hello there! I am Thibault, a consultant specialized in Digital Workplace security, at Wavestone, a French consulting company.
What do I do concretely? I help my clients to master their Microsoft 365 platform on the subjects of Security, Compliance and Identity, through the definition and implementation of controls.
Why do I like these topics? Simply because the Digital Workplace brings new surprises and challenges every day. And as a end-user myself, bringing new Ways of Working while improving security is exciting. 

In parallel, I participate in the "Office 365 and security" working group of CLUSIF, a French association gathering companies, consulting company and solution providers.  

I also hold the following certifications: 
- Microsoft 365 Certified: Security Administrator
- Microsoft 365 Certified: Enterprise Administrator Expert


## About this blog

Our job as consultants is based on sharing knowledge: with our clients, with our colleagues and with others. The community around Digial Workplace Security, Compliance and Identity topics is extremely rich and has helped me a lot. After having grown up a bit in these topics, I like to help others to find out in my turn.   
Through this blog, I want to share some feedback, thoughts and answers to problems I may have encountered.
